NYC school coding challenge


I was able to load up all the JSon data by decoding it and fetching it from the URL. 
I had a problem with the schools URL but the sat scores URL works perfectly fine.
THE schools URL from the fields worked perfectly fine but the url with all the data wont work. 
I also tried using the schools Url on quicktype.io to get a good data structure but it won't work but the Fields URL worked perfectly fine.
I am quite certain there is a problem with the URL.
I ened up creating 2 views that loads up all the school name from the test data and segues into a detailed view to show the test in detail.
